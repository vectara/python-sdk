# Examples - Getting Started
This folder contains a list of example code which can be used to get started using
Vectara with our Python SDK. The goal is to teach concepts through practice and introduce
complexity in a layered approach.

This will also show you how you can configure your system to use implicit configuration
via the file .vec_config.yaml in your home directory.

This set of examples is meant to be used along with the Getting Started deck for Vectara
which will be included in this folder.

## Working through the Notebooks
Use the chronological ordering of the notebooks to work through them one by one. 

1. 00_setup.ipynb - Create application authentication and setup your system for implicit configuration.
2. 01_query_api.ipynb - Get familiar with the three query APIs, from simple, advanced to a multi-corpus query.
3. 02_index_api.ipynb - Get familiar with the index APIs, looking at both structured and core index and the difference 
   between them
